The inspiration for this project was those old school Pinterest quotes that were extremely popular back in 2010. They usually depicted some photographic scenery with some inspirational quote layered over it. People eventually turned it into comedy and would put funny or unexpected quotes over these images, so at first glance someone would think it was going to be inspirational, but turns out to be a Lil Wayne quote. 

I wanted to recreate them using the API, but have some fun with it being randomly generated. There are three images a sun, rain, and fog that can be selected as your background. The user has a text box to start the inspiration for the quote. It’s the user’s choice for what the topic will be on, and works best to start off with the beginning of a sentence. Once the user typed out their sentence or word, they press the generate button and the text will display over the photo. The user than can shift through the backgrounds and find one that seems fitting.
